Scatterplot example with scaling using D3.js
=============================================

Using a sample set of 20 points on a cartesian plane,
use d3 to draw a scatterplot visualization of the data points.

The size of the circles in the plot are directly proportional to the 
y-value of the points. Also display text nodes representing the value
of the point next to data points.
