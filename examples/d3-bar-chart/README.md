Bar Chart example using D3.js
==============================

Using a sample set of 20 positive integers,
use d3 to draw a dynamic bar chart visualization of the data points.

The bars contain labels of the data values aligned with the tops of the bars
and is also color coded to shades of blue which get lighter for higher values.

The bar widths and text positions scale and center dynamically depending on 
the number and size of the data points.
